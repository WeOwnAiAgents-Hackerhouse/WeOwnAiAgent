If you want to set up your own self-directed IRA (SDIRA) with maximum control over your assets—including on-chain cryptocurrency investments—you will need to use a Checkbook IRA structure. This involves creating a Checkbook LLC owned by your IRA, allowing you to invest directly in crypto while maintaining IRS compliance. Below is a step-by-step guide to achieving this:
Step 1: Establish a Self-Directed IRA (SDIRA)
Step 2: Create a Checkbook LLC
Step 3: Fund the LLC
Step 4: Set Up a Crypto Wallet for Your IRA LLC
Step 5: Investing in Crypto and On-Chain Assets
Step 6: Compliance & IRS Reporting

I created a sandbox agent called "SDIRA Crypto Guide Agent" that provides guidance for setting up Self-Directed IRAs for cryptocurrency investments in Wyoming. The agent (e78031412) was created with a workflow that processes user queries and provides detailed, step-by-step instructions while maintaining an educational tone. The agent was then deployed and made accessible through an external application.
You can access the deployed agent at: https://apps.abacus.ai/chatllm/?appId=1f20262c0
Ernest and Team Members can edit the agent, you can visit: https://abacus.ai/app/model_detail/e78031412/544c87a46 
While this agent only provides guidance the obvious next steps would be to identify the task workflows and edit the agent to assist in the workflows. Maintain a checklist, and validate with the user the steps in the process from start to finish. 

Step 1: Establish a Self-Directed IRA (SDIRA)
Why?
A Self-Directed IRA (SDIRA) allows you to invest in alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. Unlike standard IRAs offered by brokerage firms (which restrict investments to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds), an SDIRA lets you hold a variety of assets, including real estate, private businesses, and crypto.
How to Set It Up
Open an SDIRA with an IRS-approved custodian that allows investments in LLCs.
Some well-known SDIRA custodians that permit checkbook control include:
Forge Trust
IRA Financial Trust
Kingdom Trust
Equity Trust
These custodians will handle the compliance and tax reporting requirements but will not have direct control over your assets.

There is an option to create your own Trust Company
1.1 Pathways to Becoming a Legal IRA Custodian
Option 1: Create a Trust Company (Most Viable Route)
You can establish a state-chartered trust company, which can legally act as an IRA custodian. Some states, like South Dakota, Wyoming, Nevada, and New Hampshire, offer low regulatory burdens for trust companies.
Steps to Establish a Trust Company as an IRA Custodian
✅ Step 1: Choose a Jurisdiction – Some states (e.g., South Dakota, Wyoming, and Nevada) have lower capital and regulatory requirements for trust companies.
✅ Step 2: Meet Minimum Capital Requirements – Some states require $1M+ in capital reserves to ensure financial stability.
✅ Step 3: Obtain a Trust Charter – File an application with the state banking commission to become a state-chartered trust company.
✅ Step 4: Register with the IRS – Apply for IRS Non-Bank Custodian (NBC) status using Form 5306-A (see Option 2).
✅ Step 5: Comply with State and Federal Regulations – Regular audits, annual filings, and adherence to SEC, IRS, and state financial laws.


Step 2: Create a Checkbook LLC
Why?
A Checkbook IRA LLC allows you to make investments directly from an LLC-owned wallet, avoiding custodial fees and giving you full control over crypto transactions.
Steps to Create the LLC
Register an LLC in a crypto-friendly state, such as Wyoming (no state income tax, strong privacy laws) or Delaware (business-friendly laws).
Draft an Operating Agreement that explicitly states the LLC is owned by the IRA and complies with IRS rules.
Obtain an EIN (Employer Identification Number) from the IRS for tax reporting purposes.
Open a business bank account in the LLC’s name to handle fiat transactions if needed.
File Articles of Organization with the state’s business registry.
Important: The LLC must be owned 100% by your IRA, not by you personally, to maintain tax-advantaged status.

Step 3: Fund the LLC
How to Move IRA Funds into Your LLC
Direct your SDIRA custodian to fund the LLC using your IRA assets.
The custodian will send funds to the LLC’s bank account.
Once funded, you (as the LLC manager) can execute crypto trades using the LLC’s wallet.

Step 4: Set Up a Crypto Wallet for Your IRA LLC
Since the LLC has checkbook control, you can open a non-custodial crypto wallet.
Best Practices for Compliance:
✅ Use a new wallet under the LLC’s name (avoid using personal wallets).
✅ Keep detailed records of all transactions.
✅ Do not use the assets for personal benefit (e.g., you cannot send crypto to your personal wallet).
✅ Ensure that all investments are made in the name of the LLC, not in your personal name.
Recommended Wallets:
Cold Storage: Ledger, Trezor (as long as it's held under LLC ownership)
Multi-Sig Solutions: Gnosis Safe, Casa (for added security)
DeFi & On-Chain Management: Fireblocks (institutional), SafePal

Step 5: Investing in Crypto and On-Chain Assets
Now that your Checkbook IRA LLC is funded, you can invest directly in:
✅ Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Altcoins via centralized or decentralized exchanges.
✅ DeFi (Lending, Staking, Yield Farming) – Some SDIRA custodians may require additional disclosures.
✅ NFTs, Tokenized Real Estate, and Other On-Chain Assets – Ensure these meet IRS guidelines for allowable investments.

Step 6: Compliance & IRS Reporting
Since you have checkbook control, you must stay compliant with IRS regulations:
✅ No Self-Dealing: You cannot personally benefit from the assets before retirement (e.g., borrowing from your IRA, living in a property purchased by your IRA, etc.).
✅ Annual Valuation: Your SDIRA custodian may require an annual valuation of the LLC’s assets.
✅ UBIT (Unrelated Business Income Tax): If your IRA LLC earns active business income (e.g., staking, yield farming, DeFi lending), you might owe UBIT taxes. Passive capital gains, however, are tax-advantaged.
✅ Form 990-T (If UBIT Applies): If your LLC generates over $1,000 in UBIT income, you must file Form 990-T with the IRS.

Advantages of This Approach
✅ Full control over crypto purchases and custody.
✅ Minimal trading fees (no custodial markups).
✅ No counterparty risk from centralized IRA providers.
✅ Ability to participate in DeFi, staking, and other on-chain opportunities.
Risks & Considerations
⚠️ Strict IRS Compliance – If the structure is misused (e.g., personal wallet use, prohibited transactions), your IRA could be disqualified, triggering immediate taxation and penalties.
⚠️ UBIT on Certain Earnings – Active crypto income (staking, liquidity pools) may be subject to Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT).
⚠️ State LLC Fees & Reporting – Some states require annual filings and fees for LLCs.

Final Thoughts
Your Checkbook IRA LLC strategy is one of the best ways to have full on-chain control over your retirement investments while avoiding custodial fees. However, you must maintain strict compliance with IRS rules to avoid penalties.
